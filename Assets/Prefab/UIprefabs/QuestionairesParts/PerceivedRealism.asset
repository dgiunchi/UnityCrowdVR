  name: Perceived realism of trajectories
  description: 'Within this part of the experiment we will ask questions about the
    realism of the crowd trajectories. Bare in mind these means that the following
    questions are not related to how the humanoid moves his limbs in order to walk
    but rather its overall trajectory in the space. '
  questions:
  - question: Were the observed trajectories real or fake ?
    helpText: The humanoid crowd you just observed can be generated using trajectories
      which are either tracked from a real crowd or generated by a simulation algorithm
      editor. Within this experiement you will be exposed to both. Do you think the
      trajectories you just observed were real (tracked from real crowd pedestrian)
      Fake (generated by a crowd algorithm simulation))
